The MPU6030 demo code is copied from

	https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/MPU6050-Pi-Demo

Thus Richard Hirst modified the Jeff Rowberg code from
    
	https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib


I basicaly have not modified the code, just changed the occurrences of i2c device number from /dev/i2c-0 to /dev/i2c-1

Everything else is my own.
